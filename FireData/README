README for /FireData

This is where fire data is stored. Specifically this is where HMS GIS data lives
locally for this project. This data is generated by the NOAA office of satellite
and product operations (http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/land/hms.html). The 
data is downloaded using R/downloadHMSSmokeData.R. Improvements to that script
are welcome. The ftp site where the data live is
ftp://satepsanone.nesdis.noaa.gov/volcano/FIRE/HMS_smoke/ . While this data is 
free to the public it is strongly recommended that you contact Mark Ruminski
(mark dot ruminski (at) noaa.gov) before using this data. Mark is extremely 
helpful and can make sure your use of the data is within its capabilities.
