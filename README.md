# SmokeInTheCity
The online home of the analysis code used for the paper published in ES&amp;T. 

This is a public project. Anyone is free to view and download the code stored here. Some of the figures have been published and are owned by Environmental Science and Technology. If you want to use any figures stored here please contact me first. If you have questions, use any of this code, or find any errors I ask that you please contact me sjbrey@rams.colostate.edu. 

### Data
This project is limited to 1 Gb of storage. As a result, I am not able to store all of the data required to run all of the script. ECMWF reanalysis data and some EPA monitoring time series data has been withheld to save space. All script used to download data and their associated URLs are imbedded in the analysis scripts.
