README for /analysisData:

This is where analysis data packets created by readGISSmokeData.R are saved. The
RData files in this directory are what is used by R/analysisPipeline to perform
the bulk of the analysis in this study. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The name of the RData file tells you how it was created and what is included. 
The name of the RData analysis data packets are as follows:

PMDataUsed_Sample.DurationOfThatPMData_StatisticUsed_PMThresholdUsed.RData

Options:

PMDataUsed = PM2.5_non_FRM_Mass | PM2.5_FRM_Mass
Sample.DurationOfThatPMData == 1 | 24, this is the averaging period of statistic
StatisticUsed = Arithmatic.Mean | X1st.Max.Value , mean or max of sample? 
PMThresholdUsed = allSummers | individualSummer , a smoke-impacted day is class-
                  fied as a day where the value is +1sd above normal. Here you 
                  choose whether that statistic is generated each summer or by
                  the entire period between startYear and endYear. 
                  
All of these specifications are arguments earlier in the data pipeline. Please
see the header comments of R/downloadEPAData.R, R/createEPASpeciesArray.R, and 
R/mergeEPASpeciesArray.R to see how these arguments are implented. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Whats inside the data packet? 

Upon loading the selected data packet an object of class list() named
workSpaceData will be loaded into the workspace. The list contains the following

"Ozone_df" = class(Ozone_df) == "matrix". Columns are monitors, rows are days.
             The colnames are the monitor IDs. 
"PM_df" = The same as Ozone_df only for co-located PM. The first 9 digits 
          corrospond to monitoring location, so these will match the colnames of
          Ozone_df. 
"PM_mdf" = Metadata of PM_df monitors. Rows are monitors, cols are data.          
"Hybrid_mdf" = Metadata of ozone monitors. The site information is the same as 
               PM_df. The only different information is specific to the 
               instrument. 
"HMSMask"  = Matrix with dimensions matching PM_df and Ozone_df. Uses PM 
             instrument ID for column name. 
"HighPMMask" = Matrix with dimensions matching PM_df, Ozone_df, HMSMask. 
               FALSE where PM not not +1sd high. TRUE where yes. 
"smokeImpactMask" = Matrix with dimensions matching PM_df, Ozone_df, HMSMask.
                    TRUE are smoke impacted dates, FALSE are dates probably not
                    impacted by smoke. 
"lat" = The latitude of the monitoring locations, in order of columns.          
"lon" = The longitude ""            
"city" = The name of the city pulled from Hybrid_mdf. In order of columns.
"cityName" = ""        
"time" = Time is an R object of class POSIXct. It matches the rownames for all 
         matricies. You can also get time with 
         as.POSIXct(rownames(Ozone_df), tz=MST)
         
NOTE: The dates are all local. I use timezone (tz) is MST for matching purposes
NOTE: and to make it clear that these are dates associated with time of 
NOTE: locations in north america. This is important in scripts where ecmwf 00Z 
NOTE: data is assigned to evenning temepratures in north america monitoring 
NOTE: locations. The date of 00Z and evenning temperatures in north america are
NOTE: not the same.
